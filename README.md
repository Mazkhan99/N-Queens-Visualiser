# N-Queens-Visualiser
# Author : [Maz Khan](https://github.com/Mazkhan99)

- The N-Queens puzzle is the problem of placing N chess queens on an N×N chessboard so that no two queens threaten each other. Thus, a solution requires that no two queens share the same row, column, or diagonal.

# How It Works

- Initialization: The visualizer sets up an N×N chessboard.
- Backtracking Algorithm: The core of the solution involves a recursive backtracking algorithm that attempts to place a queen in each row, ensuring that no two queens are in the same row, column, or diagonal.
- Real-Time Visualization: As the algorithm proceeds, the visualizer updates the board in real-time, showing each move and backtrack.
- Logs: Detailed logs display the moves and decisions made by the algorithm, helping users understand the process.

# Algorithms Used

- Recursion: The algorithm uses recursion to explore all possible placements of queens.
- Backtracking: If placing a queen leads to a conflict, the algorithm backtracks and tries a different position.
